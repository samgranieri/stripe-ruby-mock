# stripe-ruby-mock

* Homepage: https://github.com/mindeavor/stripe-ruby-mock
* Issues: https://github.com/mindeavor/stripe-ruby-mock/issues

## Install

    $ gem install stripe-ruby-mock

## Features

* No stripe server access required
* Easily test against stripe errors (soon)

## Description

** *WARNING: THIS LIBRARY IS INCOMPLETE* **

At its core, this library overrides [stripe-ruby's](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby)
request method to skip all http calls and
instead directly return test data. This allows you to write and run tests
without the need to actually hit stripe's servers.

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/samgranieri/stripe-ruby-mock.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/samgranieri/stripe-ruby-mock)
You can use stripe-ruby-mock with any ruby testing library. Here's a quick dummy example with RSpec:

```ruby
require 'stripe'
require 'stripe_mock'

describe MyApp do
  before { StripeMock.start }
  after { StripeMock.stop }

  it "should create a stripe customer" do

    # This doesn't touch stripe's servers nor the internet!
    customer = Stripe::Customer.create({
      email: 'johnny@appleseed.com',
      card: 'void_card_token'
    })
    expect(customer.email).to eq('johnny@appleseed.com')
  end
end
```

## TODO

* Cover all stripe urls/methods
* Mock stripe error responses
* Create hash for storing/retrieving stripe objects in-memory
  * Currently implemented for: **Customers**
